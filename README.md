University project for Object Oriented Programming class.
This simple app built with JavaFX lets the user manage a book collection. In this version thrown together quite quickly as a project for University, the user can add books of three types (Novel, Educational, Comicbook). Adding a whole series with a specified amount of volumes is also possible. The app has the most basic simple functionalities like filtering the entries by type, or searching for a specific string of characters in the title. 
I do plan to rebuild this app in the near future using more modern framweorks and optimizing the code not being pressured by a deadline.
